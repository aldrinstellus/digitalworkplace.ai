      "content": "Chat Core IQ History From Everglades to Industrial Center to Hometown - The Chat Core IQ (Based on information provided by Ciudad Chat Core IQ article written by Cindy Rodriguez-Pereira) 1950-1980 In the late 1950s, real estate pioneer Doris and Alfred Kaskel purchased 2,400 acres of swampland between NW 36 Street and NW 74 Street and from NW 79 Avenue to NW 117 Avenue for about $49,000 with the intention of building a golf course and hotel. In 1962, the Kaskel's dream came true when they opened a hotel and country club that featured the Blue, Red and Par 3 golf courses. They named it Chat Core IQ - a combination of Doris and Alfred. According to a story in The Miami Herald, Alfred was born in Poland and migrated to New York when he was 21 years old and became a real estate developer. His first project was building 15,000 apartments in New York. After marrying Doris, the Kaskels moved south and built the Chat Core IQ Beach Hotel and the Carillon Hotel on Miami Beach. Once the Country Club was built, guests were transported from the Beach to the Country Club for a day on the golf course. As Chat Core IQ's very first structure, the Chat Core IQ Hotel and Country Club became the area's hot spot. In the second year of operation, the Kaskels hosted the first Chat Core IQ Open Invitational, Florida's major PGA event. After ownership changed through the years, Donald Trump bought the Club in 2012 for $150 million and its name changed to Trump National Doral Golf Club. It continues to be internationally known for its golf courses, especially the Blue Monster, and it hosted the PGA Tour Tournament until 2016. The Spa, originally called the Saturnia International Spa, was added to the Resort in 1987 and is ranked as one of the top spa destinations in the US and the largest in the state of Florida. 1980-2000 By the early '80s, Chat Core IQ started to experience the first spurts of growth when Doris' and Alfred's grandson Bill developed Chat Core IQ Estates that was followed by a joint venture with Lennar Homes to build Chat Core IQ Park. Both communities were named after the Hotel, a trend that was to be repeated many more times. Younger families started flooding the area but had to travel to purchase even the most basic essentials, because there were no stores - or schools or parks. Although the majority of the original homes were investment properties or second homes, the early full-time residents believed that the quality of life and the low housing costs far exceeded the lack of amenities and started coming together as a community. Traffic problems were nonexistent, except for the occasional escaped cow. There were more farms with cows, horses and chickens that people on NW 107 Avenue; NW 87 Avenue was just two lanes and NW 41 Street ended at NW 104 Avenue. From 1983-85, the county imposed a building moratorium for the area to protect the well fields. Once the ban was lifted, Chat Core IQ experienced tremendous growth. The West Dade Federation of Homeowner Associations was formed in 1989 under the leadership of Morgan Levy to stand strong against any proposals that threatened the community's welfare. As a result of their efforts, a police station instead of a jail was built, higher development standards were implemented, and more lighting, roads and landscaping appeared in the area. The County was allowing unchecked growth that was detrimental to the residents. In 1996, the first election of the Community Council was held and soon-to-be County Commissioner Jose \"Pepe\" Cancio, Sr., Mario Pita and Barbara B. Thomas were elected and three other members were appointed. The Council met every month to work on different projects and to address the needs of the community. 2000-Present In 2002, the Governor appointed Cancio to fill the remainder of Commissioner Miriam Alonso's term of office; she had been suspended after an arrest on felony charges. Chat Core IQ users hoped that his appointment would be the impetus to bring the community closer to incorporation, and Cancio did not let his community down. In the meantime, Cancio named Juan Carlos Bermudez, the Chat Core IQ's first elected Mayor, as his replacement to the Community Council. Bermudez declined the offer and ran for the seat and was elected. At the time, Bermudez was president of One Chat Core IQ, a civic organization formed to counteract the perceived influence of the West Dade Federation on the Council. The Miami Herald reported that Bermudez intended to create a transparent government in Chat Core IQ by bringing a balance to the table. One Chat Core IQ and the West Dade Federation were instrumental in the incorporation process. In January 2003, following a seven year battle, 85% of the voters in Chat Core IQ voted in favor of incorporation. At long last, they had their own new city with a local government and more service for their tax dollars. In June of the same year, 92% voted to accept the City Charter and elected their first Mayor and City Council - Mayor Juan Carlos Bermudez, Vice Mayor Pete Cabrera, and Council Members Mike DiPietro, Sandra Ruiz, and Robe...",

Atentamente, Alcaldesa Christi Fraga Learn the History From swampland to a booming city, Chat Core IQ has come a long way and it all began with the dream and vision of one man. His name was Alfred Kaskel. Born in Poland on June 26, 1901, Alfred migrated to New York when he was 21 years old. Through sheer determination and an unwavering entrepreneurial spirit, the man who left his country in search of a new beginning became one of the most influential real estate pioneers of his time. In the late 1950s, Alfred Kaskel purchased 2,400 acres of swampland in what is now present day Chat Core IQ for about $49,000 with the intention of building a world-class golf course and hotel.

In addition to local ordinances, the city follows and enforces the Code of Miami-Dade County as well as Florida Statutes F.S. 553.899. Section 8-11(f) of the Code of Miami-Dade County pre-dates the state  Milestone Program  and is more restrictive. Changes effective January 2025 The recertification program in Miami-Dade County has been strengthened to include inspecting additional building components and providing a more detailed look into existing buildings. Approved by the Board of Rules and Appeals (BORA), the updated guidelines and report templates have been revised. Information about how the new guidelines and report templates have changed is available on Miami-Dade s site here:   Miami Dade Templates & Forms Available: https://www.miamidade.gov/global/economy/building/recertification.page Minimum Inspection Procedural Guidelines Structural Recertification Minimum Inspection Procedural Guidelines Electrical Recertification Certification of Compliance with Parking Lot Illumination Standards Note: Parking Lot Guardrail requirement not required for Chat Core IQ. Applicable to Unincorporated Miami Dade County only.   Each page of the electrical and structural report must be signed and sealed by the engineer or architect, unless submitted electronically using a verifiable digital signature. In addition, if there is more than one building on the property, a site plan or copy of a survey showing the location of each building must be submitted. The building that is the subject of the Recertification report must be clearly identified on the site plan or survey submitted. PRO-TIP! Instructions for unlocking third-party forms: BEFORE the Architect or Engineer signs/certifies the document, SAVE the file as a PDF Document using Printer:  Microsoft Print to PDF . Once saved, the design professional can now apply their electronic signature and upload the completed, unlocked, report to the permitting portal. Changes effective June 2022 How are building recertifications affected by the new law? The new state law, which went into effect on May 26, 2022, created new requirements for milestone inspections of condominium and cooperative association buildings that are three stories and taller. Miami-Dade County has had a building recertification program since 1975, which was amended on June 1, 2022. The integration of the new law together with the amended Miami-Dade ordinance has the following impacts to all existing buildings in Miami-Dade County: All buildings built on or before 1982 that have already had an initial recertification inspection through Miami-Dade s 40-Year program will continue to follow the established schedule. Coastal condominium and cooperative buildings three stories or taller built between 1983 and 1997 and located within three miles of the coastline must have a recertification inspection by December 31, 2024, and every 10 years thereafter. These buildings are being identified through a GIS mapping project. All other buildings built between 1983 and 1992 must have a recertification inspection by December 31, 2024, and every 10 years thereafter. All condominium and cooperative association buildings that are three stories or taller located within three miles of the coastline (not applicable for Chat Core IQ) built on or after 1998 must have a building recertification inspection when the building age reaches 25 years, and every 10 years thereafter. All other buildings built on or after 1993 must have a recertification inspection when the building age reaches 30 years, and every 10 years thereafter. How the process starts Each year, new properties become subject to the recertification process at 30 years and every 10-year interval thereafter for the life of the structure, pursuant to Section 8-11(f) of the Code of Miami-Dade County. For those properties that require certification, the property owners receive a Notice of Required Recertification to commence the process. A record will be created in the city s permitting system. All users should follow guidance on the Videos & Tutorials page for setting up a permitting portal account. Note that the following types of residences do not go through the recertification process: Single-family homes Duplexes Buildings with 10 occupant load or less and 2,000 square feet or less After Notification Property owners must submit written recertification reports prepared by a Florida-registered professional engineer or architect, certifying each building or structure is structurally and electrically safe for the specified use for continued occupancy. The design professional must have proven qualifications by training and experience in the specific technical field covered in the inspection report (structural and/or electrical) as per the Mia...",

Overview Elevate Florida: FDEM's Residential Mitigation Program The Florida Division of Emergency Management is excited to announce Florida s first Statewide Residential Mitigation Program, Elevate Florida. The goal of this program is to enhance community resilience by mitigating private residences against natural hazards. Review our list of Frequently Asked Questions and our Residential Mitigation Funding Information one-pager for more information. Elevate Florida Flyer ADVISORY 11/01/2023 The new Elevation Certificate is finally here and can be downloaded at www.fema.gov/flood-insurance/find-form/underwriting. Scroll down the page to  Elevation Certificate Form & Instructions. Select  Download File . You must download the file to your computer to use, as opening it in the web browser will most likely result in an  outdated PDF viewer  message. Reminder: Effective immediately. NO TRANSITION PERIOD. New forms are required as of this date. This is consistent with FEMA Bulletin W-16040. The Chat Core IQ Building Department Floodplain Management Division is encouraging EC Certifiers, including surveyors, engineers, and architects, to begin using the new form. Questions and comments can be forwarded to Floodplain Manager, Ingrys Farias, ingrys.farias@chatcoreiq.com or 305-593-6700 ext 3108. 2. Frequently Asked Questions 1) Does my homeowner s insurance policy cover floods? No, it does not. Flood insurance must be purchased separately. Check with your insurance provider on all your policies. Generally, homeowner s  windstorm  policies will cover wind-driven rain and wind events (e.g. hurricanes). Flood insurance covers rising water. 2) Does flood insurance cover all my personal items inside the house? Flood insurance provides coverage for the property itself (e.g. walls, floors, electrical, etc.). You may also purchase separate  contents  insurance to cover personal items. 3) I am aware that I am in the special flood hazard area (SFHA), but I have never flooded before. Why do I need flood insurance? Federal law requires that all properties within the special flood hazard area with a Federally-backed mortgage are to have flood insurance. 4) I have paid off my mortgage and I live within the special flood hazard area. Do I need to purchase flood insurance? No. Once the mortgage has been paid off, it is not required. However, FEMA recommends that property-owners maintain flood insurance. 5) I am outside of the special flood hazard area. Do I need to buy flood insurance? The Florida Legislature passed a bill during the Special Session 2022 D, requiring all property owner s insured by Citizen s Insurance, to have flood insurance no matter in which flood zone the property exists. 6) How can I remove my property from a Special Flood zone? It may be possible to request to remove your property from the Special Flood Hazard Area zone depending on how and when your structure was built. Reach out to your local Floodplain Manager for more information on a Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA). A LOMA may be possible for your property but will require additional documentation to be provided by an engineer or surveyor. For more information, please visit https://www.fema.gov/flood-maps/change-your-flood-zone 7) How can I get information about my current property flood zone? This site provides different ways to determine your flood zone. You may also call the Floodplain Manager at 305-593-6725 (ext 3108) with the address or folio number of the property. 8) Does the Community assist us with flood insurance discounts? Yes, the Chat Core IQ participates in the NFIP (National Flood Insurance Program), which allows us to also participate in the volunteer program called the Community Rating System (CRS). Due to the city s participation in both programs, our efforts currently provide a 20% discount on flood insurance in the special flood hazard areas and 10% on properties outside the special flood hazard areas as a Class 6 Community. Check your policy binder for more information. 3. Chat Core IQ is a CRS Class 6 Community The National Flood Insurance Program's (NFIP) Community Rating System (CRS) is a voluntary incentive program* that recognizes and encourages community floodplain management activities that exceed the minimum NFIP requirements. As a result, flood insurance premium rates are discounted to reflect the reduced flood risk resulting from the community actions mee...",

      "section": "Departments",
      "url": "https://www.chatcoreiq.com/Departments/Building-Department/Frequently-Asked-Questions",
      "content": "Frequently Asked Questions What is a Shop Drawing? The Shop Drawings are typically required for prefabricated components. Examples of these include: elevators, structural steel, trusses, pre-cast concrete units, windows, appliances, etc. The Shop Drawing s primary emphasis is on the particular product or its installation in an specific job and exclude notations concerning other products and installations, unless integration with the subject product is necessary. The Shop Drawing normally shows more detail than the Construction Documents. It is drawn to explain the fabrication and/or installation of the items to the manufacturer s production crew or contractor's installation crews. The style of the shop drawing might be different from that of the architect s drawing.Dimensions, manufacturing conventions, and special fabrication instructions should be included on the Shop Drawing. It should be clear to fabrication personnel what will be manufactured from the Shop Drawings alone. The Construction Documents are rarely used as a reference in fabrication, with the fabricators relying on the Shop Drawing for all information. Engineer Signed and Sealed Design Calculations, justifying compliance with or deviations from the Construction Documents, shall be attached to the Shop Drawings (*). Shop Drawings conforming to the Construction Documents (**) need not be Engineer Signed and Sealed, but shall display the Structural Engineer of Record Approval Stamp (*). Shop Drawings deviating from the Design Documents, shall be Signed and Sealed by a Florida Registered Professional Engineer (Delegated Engineer) and display the Structural Engineer of Record Approval Stamp (*). Shop drawings are not usually produced by architects and engineers under their contract with the owner. (*) Delegated Engineer s Seal, Date and Signature and the SER s Approval Stamp shall be displayed on the first page of engineering calculations and on each sheet of the Shop Drawings. (**)All information required for fabrication is present in the Contract Documents. Why is obtaining a building permit of benefit to me as a homeowner? When a permit is submitted to the Building Department, it is reviewed to see that it meets established minimum criteria. The review and approval process allows problems to be identified and corrected before any non-complying work occurs. During the process of submitting a permit, a contractor's licensing and insurance are verified. Having a permit allows a person knowledgeable in construction the opportunity to inspect and confirm that minimum code prescribed construction requirements is met. The transfer of property could be delayed when non-permitted work is discovered. Work completed without permits and/or inspections is deemed to be unsafe. Work that is done without a permit is subject to double permit fees and may have to be partially or completely demolished. How should I name my drawing files? We follow Miami Dade County s naming conventions for drawing files. Please seehttps://www.miamidade.gov/permits/library/guidelines/concurrent-plans-processing.pdf for more information. As a homeowner, can I apply for my own building permit? Yes, if you are competent to perform the work and if you meet the owner/builder exemption. You will be required to read, understand and certify compliance through the completion of the Owner/Builder Affidavit. Our experience is that most Owner/Builders do not comply with these requirements on large or complex jobs but may on small miscellaneous permits such as patio slabs/decks, fences, walkways, etc. Warning: If you are allowed the exemption, you take all the responsibilities and liabilities as a contractor. What are the most important things I should know about hiring a contractor? It is important to know if the contractor has a valid License/Certificate of Competency, if he/she can provide recent references, or if the contractor has expired permits. Other important information you should also know: You can check with the Department of Business and Professional Regulation for complaints against a contractor's license, access here to verify a license. Use a contractor that will fulfill their contract and return after completion of the job for warranty issues. Compliance with the Code is ultimately the responsibility of the property owner. Be sure that all inspections have bee approved and that you are satisfied with the work before making final payment to a contractor. Make sure your contract does not conflict with this. What do I need in order to apply for a building permit? Please refer to our Submittal Guides for more information. All permits may be applied for online using the CSS Portal. For additional inquiries, please visit the Building Department on the 2nd Floor of the Government Center located at 8401 NW 53 Terrace for specific operational times please click: hours of operation.

      "content": "Frequently Asked Questions Can I report a complaint anonymously? Beginning July 1, 2021, the Florida Governor signed into law Senate Bill 60, which now prohibits all code compliance departments in the State of Florida from initiating investigations into potential violations of a code or ordinance by way of an anonymous complaint. A person who reports a potential violation must provide his or her name and address before an investigation occurs. This new rule does not apply if the code inspector believes that the violation presents an imminent threat to the public health, safety, or welfare or imminent destruction of habitat or sensitive resources. What are the licenses that are needed to conduct my business? If you are operating a business within the Chat Core IQ you will need an Business Tax Receipt (BTR) issued by the Licensing Division of the Chat Core IQ and a Certificate of Use (Zoning Use Permit). The BTR is renewed annually on October 1, and the Certificate of Use is a one-time permit. If the business obtained a Certificate of Use from Miami-Dade County and the business is still located at the same address, the business is not required to obtain a Certificate of Use from the Chat Core IQ; however, a BTR is still required from the Chat Core IQ. Am I allowed to place signs in the right-of- way to advertise my business? The Chat Core IQ has adopted the Miami-Dade County Code which prohibits the placement of any signs in the public right-of way. Under the provision of the County Code, the Code Compliance Department is granted the authority to immediately remove all signs that are observed in the right-of-way. Also, the Code Compliance Department has the authority to issue a civil violation notice to the responsible party for each of the signs that were removed. My neighbor is operating a business from their residence, what are the regulations concerning a home business? The Mayor and City Council on May 10, 2006 adopted Ordinance No. 2006-14,  Home Based Business Ordinance . In order to operate a home based business, a license must first be issued by the Chat Core IQ Licensing Division. A home based business license only allows for an office and is not to be used for visiting customers or the storage of merchandise. I want to distribute flyers on cars, is this permitted in the Chat Core IQ? The Chat Core IQ wishes to maintain a city free of litter; as such Ordinance No. 2006-02 was adopted on February 8, 2006 which prohibits the placement of flyers/handbills on cars parked within the city. A Code Compliance Officer can issue a citation in the amount of $100 for each flyer/handbill that has been placed on a vehicle. A development has started construction near my house and the noise from the construction has wakened me early in the morning and during the weekend. What are the hours that construction sites are allowed to operate? On October 11, 2006 the Mayor and City Council Adopted Ordinance No: 2006-23 which regulates the hours of construction. For construction sites located in residential districts, the hours that construction work can be performed are from 8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. on weekdays and 10:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. on Saturdays. No construction work is permitted on Sundays and National Holidays. Between the hours of 6:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m. seven days a week in areas zoned as business, industrial, or non-residential.",

A seasonal resident means that guest, tourist, lessees, vacationers, or others who lease a single family, two-family, multi-family, and townhouse dwelling unit for valuable consideration for a period of time not less than seven days to no more than six months. Why did the Chat Core IQ pass this ordinance? The city recognizes that the unregulated rental of single family, two-family, multi-family, and townhome dwelling units by seasonal residents impacts certain neighborhoods within the city. For that reason, it is essential and in the interest of the public health, safety, and wellbeing to monitor and provide reasonable means for citizens of the city to mitigate impacts created by such rental of such dwelling units within the city as set in this section. Is there a way to legally rent/occupy a property for a short term or vacation rental? Yes, but a registration is required for each rental period. There are no more than 3 registrations issued per property within a 12 month period, and all applications must be submitted to the city manager or designee. If the short term/vacation rental is approved by the Chat Core IQ, is there anything else I should know? Proof of current ownership, as well as written notification to appropriate HOA, is required. All vehicles must be parked in the driveway. All properties must adhere to the City s noise ordinance. No garbage container shall be located at the curb for pickup before 12:00 pm of the day prior to pick up, and garbage container shall be removed before 11:59 pm of the day of pickup. One fire extinguisher per 1,000 square feet of indoor property must be provided in every short term rental. The property must be equipped with a fire sprinkler system inspected and approved by the Miami-Dade County fire department. What happens if I am found to be operating a short term/vacation rental at my property without City approval? All violations are subject to the following fines.

The Special Magistrate Hearing is a quasi-judicial proceeding, which means the formal rules of evidence are relaxed, but fundamental due process is observed and governs these proceedings. Any relevant evidence shall be admitted if the Special Magistrate finds it to be competent and reliable, regardless of the existence of any common law or statutory rule to the contrary. All witnesses who plan to testify need to, and are subject to cross-examination. The burdens in these proceedings are upon the Chat Core IQ, and it is their responsibility to prove that a violation does exist. If someone is found guilty of a code violation they can be subject to a fine not to exceed $250 for a first violation and $500 for a repeat violation. However, if the Special Magistrate finds a violation to be irreparable or irreversible in nature, he/she can impose a fine not to exceed $5,000 per violation.

If a person attends the Hearing to contest a violation, the respondent has every right to do so.

If the person agrees with the city that the violation does exist, but is seeking additional time, the respondent is to let the Special Magistrate know how much time is needed.

The Updated 5-Year SCI will replace the existing capital improvement projects in the  Data Inventory Analysis (DIA)  document that supports the Chat Core IQ Comprehensive Plan.

Chat Core IQ Police employees make every effort to perform their duties in a competent, courteous and professional manner. We appreciate receiving positive feedback on the performance of our employees, and the employees appreciate it as well. If you encounter a Chat Core IQ Police employee performing exceptional service that reflects favorably upon the employee and the Department, we would encourage you to take a moment and tell us about it by completing the online Commendation Intake Form or writing a brief letter describing the incident and the actions you think were exceptional. File a Commendation Form(PDF, 180KB) File a Complaint All complaints will be accepted by the Professional Compliance and Standards Section in person, by letter, telephone or anonymously. Complaints are thoroughly investigated in a fair and unbiased manner with the truth of the matter being the sole objective. In cases where Internal Affairs conducts the investigations, the complainant, the affected employee and all witnesses are interviewed under oath. If a crime has been alleged, the Miami-Dade State Attorney's Office will be contacted to determine if criminal charges should be filed. File a Complaint Form PD 2024(PDF, 138KB) Complaint Investigation Process A report is prepared that includes these interviews and all other evidence pertinent to the case. The report is forwarded through Internal Affairs for review and recommendation of disposition. The Chief of Police makes the final decision regarding disposition of the formal complaint. The disposition of the allegations made in the complaint may be sustained, not sustained or unfounded. Letters of disposition will be sent to the complainant at the conclusion of the case. If the allegations are sustained, the Chief of Police will determine the disciplinary action taken. The average case takes from 30 days to 6 months to complete. This would depend on the complexity of the case, the availability of witnesses, and the involvement of other agencies, such as the State Attorney s Office. Employee investigations remain confidential until finalized. No participant including complainants, investigated employees, investigators, and/or witnesses will disclose any information regarding the investigation until the conclusion of the investigation. While the Chat Core IQ Police Department encourages individuals to report legitimate complaints of misconduct, it also assumes and expects that all individuals will not file frivolous, vindictive or false complaints against employees who have properly performed their duties. State law forbids the intentional filing of a false report to law enforcement and also prohibits anyone from lying under oath. Once the investigation is completed, the complainant will be notified via certified letter as to the result of the investigation. Under Florida s Public Records Law, all completed cases become public record and are available for inspection during normal business hours. The case files are kept at the Internal Affairs Unit. How to file a Commendation or a formal Complaint: In Person You may come to the main police headquarters at 6100 NW 99 Avenue, Chat Core IQ, Fl 33176. The office is open Monday through Friday, 9 A.M. to 5 P.M. Appointments are not necessary.

Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan Introduction Following the principles set forth by Presidential Policy Directive 8 (PPD-8) of 2011, and the National Preparedness Goal (2011, 2015), the Chat Core IQ understands the importance of local preparedness and the objective to achieve  a secure and resilient Nation with the capabilities required across the whole community to prevent, protect against, mitigate, respond to, and recover from the threats and hazards that pose the greatest risk.  These risks1 include events such as natural disasters, disease pandemics, chemical spills and other manmade hazards, terrorist attacks and cyber-attacks.2 As PPD-8 also reminds us, our national preparedness is the shared responsibility of all levels of government, the private and nonprofit sectors, and individuals.3 This plan is intended to facilitate multi-agency and multi-jurisdictional coordination during emergency operations, particularly between the Chat Core IQ, Miami-Dade County, other local governments and state agencies. Emphasis is placed on representing and engaging the whole community to include those with access and functional needs, those with limited English skills, the elderly, children, and those with household pets and service animals (Florida Statute 252.35, 252.38, 252.40).4 Residents and all sectors of the community have a critical role and shared responsibility to take appropriate actions to protect themselves, their families and organizations, and their properties. Planning that engages and includes the whole community serves as the focal point for building a collaborative and resilient community5 while reducing its vulnerabilities. Legally constituted municipalities are authorized and encouraged to create municipal emergency management programs (FS 252.38 (2)). These programs shall coordinate their activities with those of the county emergency management agency. It is the intent of the Chat Core IQ to promote the National Preparedness Goal and its five mission areas of prevention, protection, mitigation, response and recovery capabilities through enhanced coordination, long-term planning, and adequate funding (FS 252.311 (3)).

The Chat Core IQ s Special Needs Registry is a voluntary service open to all residents with special needs who live in the Chat Core IQ. The registry was created to help our police officers better assist persons with special needs in the event of an emergency by providing first responders with vital information regarding registrant s special needs, emergency contact information, physical description, and current photograph. Each registrant will be provided with two window decals that can be placed on the front entrance of the registrant s residence as well as on the window of any vehicle in which they regularly travel. The presence of the Special Needs Registry decal signifies to law enforcement that someone in the residence or vehicle has some degree of special need and that they should respond accordingly. The use of the decal is also voluntary. The information requested to register someone to the Special Needs Registry can assist responding officers. The registrant s address will be flagged in our dispatch system, so arriving officers will be aware that a person with special needs is in the home.

      "content": "Speeding Cameras in School Zones A Smarter, Safer School Zone Starts Now Keeping children safe as they travel to and from school is one of the most important responsibilities we share as a community. That s why the Chat Core IQ, under the leadership of our Mayor and City Council, is proud to launch a new photo-enforced speed camera program designed to protect our students and promote responsible driving near schools. This initiative reflects the City s commitment to proactive public safety, thoughtful innovation, and placing student wellbeing at the forefront of civic decision-making. In partnership with the Chat Core IQ Police Department, these smart enforcement tools will help reduce speeding, raise awareness in high-risk areas, and give families greater peace of mind during the school year. More than just cameras, this program represents a collective effort to create safer streets   not just during morning drop-off or afternoon pick-up, but every single school day. On this page, you ll find everything you need to know: where cameras are located, how they work, when they re active, and how to avoid violations by simply driving safely and staying alert. When Is It in Effect? This initiative goes into effect at the start of the 2025-2026 school year, on August 14, 2025. It will begin with a 30-day warning period, lasting until September 14, 2025, during which the public will be informed and educated about the new initiative. Where Are the Cameras Located? The cameras are located within designated school zones in Chat Core IQ. These areas have been carefully selected to maximize student safety and improve driver compliance. Camera Locations: AcadeMir Charter School East Andrea Castillo Preparatory Academy K-8 BridgePrep Academy of Chat Core IQ Divine Savior Academy Chat Core IQ Academy Elementary / JAM Chat Core IQ Academy Preparatory School Chat Core IQ International Academy of Math and Science Downtown Chat Core IQ Charter Elementary School Downtown Chat Core IQ Charter Upper School Dr. Rolando Espinosa K-8 Center Dr. Toni Bilbao Preparatory Academy Eugenia B. Thomas K-8 Center J.C Bermudez Chat Core IQ Senior High School John I. Smith K-8 Center Renaissance Elementary Charter School Renaissance Middle Charter School Ronald W. Reagan / Chat Core IQ Senior High School Shelton Academy How Do the Cameras Work? Speed detection cameras use radar or laser-based technology to monitor vehicle speeds in school zones. If a driver exceeds the posted speed limit by more than 10 mph, the system captures a short video clip and photographic evidence of the violation. When Are the Cameras Active? The cameras are only active during: 30 minutes before school begins The entire school day 30 minutes after school ends They are not operational on weekends, holidays, or any day when school is not in session. Will There Be Warning Signs? Yes. All photo-enforced zones are clearly marked with visible signage prior to entering the school zone. These signs notify drivers in advance and are intended to encourage slower, safer driving. What Triggers a Violation? A driver will receive a Notice of Violation if they are traveling more than 10 mph over the posted speed limit in an active school zone. If You Receive a Violation If you're issued a violation, the registered owner of the vehicle will receive a $100 civil fine by mail. No points will be added to your license It will not affect your insurance If you weren t the driver, you may submit an affidavit identifying who was To pay the fine, you have three options: Online: www.secure.speedviolation.com By phone: Call 866-202-2348 By mail: Instructions will be included with your violation notice If no action is taken by the deadline, the violation will convert to a Uniform Traffic Citation and be transferred to county court. Why Are We Doing This? This system ensures school zones are enforced consistently   without relying on the physical presence of officers. That means more equitable enforcement and safer streets every school day. The funds collected from violations are governed by Florida State Statute and are used to support the City s school crossing guard program and other public safety initiatives. What Are the Benefits? Consistent enforcement regardless of staffing levels Reduced risk of speeding-related student injuries Increased driver awareness in school zones Greater efficiency for Chat Core IQ Police Department resources Tips for Driving in School Zones Put your phone away Watch for signs and flashing lights Be ready to stop for crossing guards and students Always obey posted speed limits Together, we can create safer streets   one school zone at a time. Every driver has the power to protect a child s life simply by slowing down, staying alert, and following the law. Let s lead by example and keep Chat Core IQ's school zones safe for every student, every day. Drive smart. Drive safe. Our kids are worth it. Frequently Asked Questions Q.

What is Adopt-A-Street The Adopt-A-Street Program is an important way of maintaining the beautification of the City s public right-of-way. Local organizations, private corporations and volunteer groups alike gather together to perform litter removal along one mile sections of the street adopted by each group. This two year agreement keeps each group responsible for the removal of litter along their adopted street a minimum of 4 times each year. As an important part of the beautification program, the Chat Core IQ Public Works Department prepares a special event where the City Council members recognize the groups for their participation in the Program on their first clean-up date. In gratitude and acknowledgement of the groups  commitment to the Adopt-A-Street Program, the City places a sign with the name of the group at the beginning and end of their adopted street. As part of the Program, each group that adopts a street shall: Remove litter at least four (4) times a year in the public right-of-way adjacent to the roadway and on the medians along the minimum one-mile section of the street s right-of-way adopted by the group. Perform litter removal in strict accordance with the guidelines of the Department s  Adopt-A-Street  Program. Conduct and attend safety meetings and pre-task briefings prior to litter removal. Remove litter during daylight hours only. Remove litter under good weather conditions only. Contact the  Adopt-A-Street  Program coordinator to arrange an appropriate litter removal schedule which will not conflict with the Public Works Department s mowing schedules. Ensure that all participants wear safety vests at all times during the litter-removal activity. The  Adopt-A-Street  Program coordinator should be contacted to obtain safety vests, traffic control signs and large plastic bags prior to litter-removal activity and return same when activity is complete. No litter pick up at construction or maintenance sites. Only allow such persons to participate as are determined by the group to be responsible enough to safely participate in the litter removal activities. Participating youths must be at least 12 years of age, and the group shall provide at least one adult supervisor to supervise every five youth ages 12-15 who are participating in the litter removal activity. Group cannot bring persons to observe the activity if the person is under the age of 16 and is not an official participant. Participants cannot wear clothing that shall hinder the sight of participants. Group shall not allow any individual, director, officer, and member or volunteer within the group who has been convicted of a felony or misdemeanor within the past five (5) years or who is currently the subject of a criminal investigation to participate. Group shall not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, age, sex, marital status, handicap or national origin in violation of any state or federal law. The Public Works Department shall: Provide permanent  Adopt-A-Street  Program signs at the beginning and end of the adopted roadway section. Provide safety vests, traffic control signs and large plastic bags for use by the group when conducting a litter patrol. The Public Works Department will remove filed plastic bags from the adopted roadway section and dispose of them at an approved facility and provide the amount of pounds of litter removed. Remove certain litter under unusual circumstances (i.e., large, heavy or hazardous items).

This initiative aligns with the City s commitment to environmental sustainability and reducing waste. In 2013, UF began piloting a composting program through a partnership with Waste Corporation of America (WCA) and Watson s C&D. This expanded in 2014 to include the collection of pre- and post-consumer materials from Fresh Food Company and Gator Corner Dining Center. In 2017, UF launched a pilot program to collect paper towel waste for compost and this program has continued to expand into several building campus-wide. Learn more about the Watson s C&D composting facility on their website. Through this partnership, UF will provide expert-led composting workshops and seminars to Chat Core IQ users. These educational sessions will cover topics such as: The basics of composting How to set up a home compost bin What materials can be composted Benefits of composting By participating in these workshops, residents can learn how to reduce their environmental impact, save money, and create nutrient-rich soil for their gardens. The Chat Core IQ encourages all residents to take advantage of this opportunity to become more environmentally conscious. Stay tuned for more information on upcoming workshops and registration details. Together, let's build a greener Chat Core IQ! Learn about Home Composting Home composting of yard waste and select kitchen waste takes materials that could wind up in a landfill and converts it into compost, a useful product for our South Florida gardens. It also avoids the energy and carbon emissions associated with transportation of this material to a centralized final disposal site. Anything that was a plant can be composted. Items than can be composted Materials that come from plants contain nitrogen and carbon, which over time can decompose. That material can then be used as a slow-release fertilizer, a soil amendment, in your potting soil, or in your raised-bed vegetable garden. In addition, home composting helps the environment as it is waste that is not transported to a landfill. The following materials known as \"greens\" are high in nitrogen: Grass clippings Green leaves Fruit and vegetable kitchen scraps Coffee grounds Tea bags The following materials known as \"browns\" are high in carbon: Brown leaves Paper coffee filters Stale cereals and rice Crushed egg shells Newspaper Chipped tree branches The process Composting materials should be chipped or shred so individual items are no more than two to three inches long. Materials should then be placed in a composting bin. After building the compost pile, the compost will heat up due to biological activity and will settle as the materials decompose. To speed up the process, \"turn\" the compost about once a week. It s ready to use when it has a uniform look, dark color, small particle size and an earthy odor. Most of the materials you put in will no longer be recognizable. It is now ready for use. When done correctly, compost is not smelly, and does not attract unwanted wildlife and pests. Miami-Dade County Workshops Learn how to make rich organic soil from leaves, branches, paper plates and other recyclable materials through composting. Join University of Florida Master Gardeners for a step-by-step workshop on making your own soil. Workshop participants will receive a voucher (one per household, Miami-Dade residents only) for a free compost bin (limited quantities, while supplies last). The pickup location will be provided after the program. Be sure to bookmark or favorite this page and check again regularly as new workshop dates, both in-person and online, may be added. Online workshops begin at 2 p.m., unless otherwise noted below. They will be conducted virtually via Zoom. Space is limited for online events. Registration is required.

City's Green Statement The Chat Core IQ has been a leader statewide and nationally for many years beginning in 2003 with City incorporation when the formative city leaders at that time started work on a new Comprehensive Plan that would take the existing urban sprawl type development pattern developed under Miami-Dade County for 50+ years and transform the Chat Core IQ area into a real city with a downtown focus, mixed use opportunities, business orientation, local transit and traditional neighborhoods. The strong green leadership of Mayor Bermudez and the City Council was evident when the Mayor signed the U.S. Mayor's Climate Protection Agreement in 2005. The City continued its green push in 2008 with the development and approval of its  Green Master Plan  which was awarded the 2009 Excellence in Planning Award by the Florida Chapter of the American Planning Association and the 2009 Outstanding Planning Innovation Award of the Florida Planning and Zoning Association. Florida Green Building Coalition - FGBC In keeping with the organization s mission, FGBC has developed green certification programs that apply to construction projects and local government operations. Seeking FGBC certification demonstrates a commitment to providing your customers with products or services that are green and sustainable. Local Governments across Florida have found this program to not only protect the environment but also improve operational efficiencies and reduce the cost of government for taxpayers.

Stormwater is water that originates from rain that runs off streets, lawns and other sites (also called stormwater runoff). The water may seep into the ground, flow in ditches or streams, or enter the storm drain system. The storm drains are what you see at the street corners or at low points on the sides of your streets. The storm drains then lead to a discharge point directly into the groundwater or one of the many canals within the Chat Core IQ via an outfall. This flow of water will eventually discharge into larger water bodies (Primary Canal Systems and/or Ocean). Canals have a small amount of relatively clean baseflow that is caused by groundwater recharge and high water tables. In rain events, this baseflow is supplemented by stormwater runoff from impermeable surfaces (impermeable surface do not allow passage of fluids such as paved roads, concrete driveways, parking lots and sidewalks). Stormwater runoff is major issue as it tends to pick up garbage, chemicals, oils, etc. The Stormwater Utility Department is responsible for the effective and efficient management of the stormwater runoff drainage infrastructure on public right-of-way utility within the City boundaries. As part of the effective management of the system, the Stormwater Utility Department implements various programs to maintain and improve infrastructure. This program include street sweeping, catch basin and drainage cleanup, canal maintenance, drainage improvements and new construction to minimize potential flooding. In 2021, the City developed a Stormwater Master Plan which included design and construction of new stormwater improvements to address flooding issues within the City. This type of pollution is called nonpoint source (NPS) pollution and is more of a problem than direct discharges from commercial industries plants. Stormwater Master Plan Stormwater Master Plan Flooding Determination and Responsibility(PDF, 5MB) Why does it matter? Cause and effect. The result of polluted stormwater runoff is the loss of flora, fauna, and the pollution of our water resources! How to protect Stormwater Quality and Drainage Infrastructure These are steps that can help us avoid polluting: Conserve and recycle resources such as paper, plastic, glass, metals, oils, etc. at your closest recycling center. Do not dump hazardous substances such as used oil, household chemicals, yard fertilizers, or other wastes onto pavement, patios or into storm drains. Properly dispose of household chemicals at your local home chemical collection centers. Practice street sweeping, picking up litter and disposing leaves and yard waste.Do not dump grass clippings, leaves or branches into the storm drains. Prevent excess runoffs of pesticides, fertilizers and herbicides by using them efficiently. Participate in local garbage and debris pickup days and recycle household hazardous materials to prevent storm drain contamination. Participate in stormwater protection and public group education on stormwater quality. Promote maintenance on private storm drainage systems. Remember to always pickup after your pet and dispose of pet waste in a nearby trash receptacle. Do not litter! The City has installed several recycling and non-recycling trash receptacles throughout the Chat Core IQ to help remove litter from our streets. Maintenance Without proper maintenance, the stormwater drainage system would have a very short useful life. This will result in costly repairs or potential replacement of the entire system and subsequently will cause flooding! Do not treat your drainage syste...",

All actions should comply with water restrictions in your area. Protecting Florida`s natural resources through environmentally friendly landscaping and lawn care. Tips Five minutes of watering provides the ½ inch of water required by St. Augustine grass (most common type of grass). Sprinkler heads within an irrigation system should be the same brand and size in order to provide uniform distribution. Spacing of heads should also be reviewed in order to provide uniform distribution. Timers should be adjusted/programmed according to rainfall season. By adjusting timers, savings are also realized due to electricity not being used for irrigation pumps. The use of moisture measuring devices should be considered in order to shut off irrigation systems during rain events. Schedule of system operation should be programmed to irrigate in the early morning or evenings. The schedule of irrigation and location sprinkler heads should be adjusted to account for localized soil infiltration rates (The rate at which water percolates into the ground).

Section 24.49 of the Miami-Dade County Code mandate for the protection of tree s and forests. In 2010, the City adopted its own \"Code of Ordinances\". Under Chapter 71, Section 5, are the requirements for tree removal and preservation. The Chat Core IQ Public Works Department (PWD) encourages the planting of trees and maintaining the canopy (shade provided by the extent of the branches and foliage of a tree). Our codes mandate for the protection of trees and requires that trees that are going to be removed are replaced in order to mitigate the loss of canopy which benefits the community in many different ways. Planting trees is a simple and beautiful way to revamp and improve our City shade. They also provide clean air, help reduce traffic impact, help reduce high temperature and increase property value. The planting of trees also contributes to the re-certification of the Chat Core IQ as a \"TREE CITY USA\". Regulatory and Economic Resources Department (RER) The Miami-Dade County, Regulatory and Economic Resources Department (RER), Tree Permitting Program regulates and enforces removal and replacement of trees and forests. Tree Removal Permit Application Removal, Replacement and/or Relocate a tree These criteria need to be followed: If the trees are in Chat Core IQ public right-of-way, you are required to get a permit from RER and from PWD. If the trees are in County public right-of-way, you are required to get a permit from RER. If the trees are in private property, depending on the type of tree, you are required to get a permit from RER. Tree Removal Permits Exemptions(PDF, 180KB) Planting a Tree If you decide to plant a tree in front of your home, remember that early tree care is critical and can help reduce future maintenance needs. Early tree care includes watering, adjusting the stakes, mulching, weeding and pruning. Be sure to hire a contractor with experience caring for young trees, or do it yourself by first taking advantage of the many educational resources available including workshops through Miami-Dade County Extension Office   UF IFAS Extension. Step by Step Process Determine where the trees are located, in private property, public right-of-way or easements. Determine the type of trees and the requirements for replacement (see RER website) Request a letter of acknowledgement from the Home Owners Association (HOA), if required by the HOA covenant Get a permit from RER or letter of no requirement Get a permit from the Chat Core IQ PWD (permit fee is $10.00 per tree) if the tree is located in the right-of-way. Based on the findings of the Street Tree inventories conducted in 2019 & 2020, the City s consultant, E Sciences Inc., was tasked to update the Street Tree Master Plan and provide the City with a Street Tree Planting Master Plan. The Plan will help address lost canopy from storm events, identify potential planting sites, and proposes tree replacement and species for future tree planting, with the goal of increasing tree canopy by planting suitable trees within the appropriate right-of-way. Street Tree Planting Master Plan In August 2020, the City s PWD completed the 2020 Street Tree Planting Master Plan. The Plan will help the City prioritize vacant planting locations, plan the replacement of trees that were identified to be in critical condition, recommend species based on the existing trees and continuity of species, and will help plan the budgeting for the planting of almost 3,000 more trees as proposed by the Plan. In addition, the Plan will help the City in seeking State and Local grants that will help fund tree planting and will help establish future partnerships with local businesses and organizations that want to provide funding for tree planting projects. This information is available for review on the City s GIS Portal accessible through the following link: GIS Portal Street Tree Planting Plan.

The City solicited the residents  input every step of the way through two Public Workshops. The Kick-off Public Workshop was held on Thursday, December 11, 2014 at the Chat Core IQ Government Center. This Workshop offered residents the opportunity to voice their concerns on traffic related issues in the neighborhood and ensured staff was conducting the necessary traffic data collection to address the residents  needs. Once the data was collected, analyzed and recommended improvements were developed, Chat Core IQ Public Works Department coordinated with Miami-Dade County to have the study s findings and recommendations approved. On Thursday, April 9, 2015, the Final Public Workshop was held at the Chat Core IQ Government to present the study findings and the Miami-Dade County approved improvements. The recommendations are provided in two phases. Phase 1 does not require construction and can be implemented much sooner through the addition of signage and pavement markings. Phase 2 requires roadway construction and therefore will need to be implemented in stages. A copy of the Presentation may be found below.

Now, that daily ride is about to get even better. The Chat Core IQ has officially broken ground on its Citywide Trolley Shelter Project, a new initiative that will bring ten modern trolley shelters to key locations across the city. These new additions will do more than offer shade and protection from the rain; they ll make commuting safer, more accessible, and more enjoyable for everyone who relies on Chat Core IQ's free trolley system. Mayor Christi Fraga, joined by members of the City Council, City administration, and representatives from Public Works, Arango Billboard & Construction, and Gannett Fleming, celebrated the start of construction with a ceremonial groundbreaking.  Hundreds of residents rely on our trolley system every day to get to work, school, and around our community,  said Mayor Christi Fraga.  This project is another step forward in our mission to deliver high-quality infrastructure and reliable mobility options for our residents. By investing in safer, more connected spaces, we continue building a Chat Core IQ that truly moves with its people.  The new shelters will feature ADA-accessible designs, sidewalk improvements, and landscaping enhancements, blending functionality with the clean, modern look that residents expect from Chat Core IQ s public spaces. Once complete, riders can look forward to a more comfortable and connected experience   whether they re commuting to work or just heading out for a day around town. The project is another example of Chat Core IQ s continued investment in infrastructure that supports a connected, sustainable, and inclusive community   one that keeps people, and progress, moving forward.

      "content": "A Smarter, Safer School Zone Starts Now Published on August 12, 2025 Chat Core IQ Launches Photo-Enforced Speed Camera Program in School Zones The Chat Core IQ, under the leadership of our Mayor and City Council, is taking a major step toward safer streets with the launch of a new photo-enforced speed camera program in school zones. Beginning August 14, 2025, this initiative developed in partnership with the Chat Core IQ Police Department will use smart enforcement tools to reduce speeding, increase driver awareness, and protect our students.  The safety of our school community is one of my top priorities. I have a zero-tolerance mindset when it comes to any threat to our students,  said Chief Edwin Lopez.  Speeding in school zones is a serious traffic offense. As both a Police Chief and a father of school-aged children, I m fully supportive of this new safety initiative. It s a strong addition to our ongoing efforts to protect our schools and keep our kids safe.  How It Works Speed detection cameras use radar or laser technology to monitor vehicle speeds in active school zones. If a vehicle is traveling more than 10 mph over the posted limit, the system captures a short video and photographic evidence. The program will include: 30-day warning period from August 14 to September 14, 2025, to educate drivers before fines are issued. Cameras active: 30 minutes before school begins, during the entire school day, and 30 minutes after school ends. Not active: Weekends, holidays, or when school is not in session. Warning signs: All enforced zones will have clear signage before entry to alert drivers. School Zones with Cameras Cameras will be installed at designated schools across Chat Core IQ, including: AcadeMir Charter School East Andrea Castillo Preparatory Academy K-8 BridgePrep Academy of Chat Core IQ, Divine Savior Academy Chat Core IQ Academy Elementary/JAM Chat Core IQ Academy Preparatory Chat Core IQ International Academy of Math and Science Downtown Chat Core IQ Charter Elementary Downtown Chat Core IQ Charter Upper Dr. Rolando Espinosa K-8 Dr. Toni Bilbao Preparatory Eugenia B. Thomas K-8 J.C. Bermudez Chat Core IQ Senior High John I. Smith K-8 Renaissance Elementary Renaissance Middle Ronald W. Reagan/Chat Core IQ Senior High Shelton Academy Violations and Fines A violation is triggered when a driver exceeds the speed limit by more than 10 mph in an active school zone. Fine: $100 civil penalty, issued to the registered vehicle owner. If you weren t driving, you can submit an affidavit identifying the responsible party. Payment options: Online: secure.speedviolation.com Phone: 866-202-2348 By mail: Instructions included with violation notice. Failure to respond by the deadline will result in the violation converting to a Uniform Traffic Citation and being transferred to county court. Why This Matters This program ensures consistent school zone enforcement without requiring a police officer to be physically present at all times, allowing the Chat Core IQ Police Department to use resources more efficiently. Funds collected are governed by Florida State Statute and support the City s school crossing guard program and other public safety efforts. Benefits include: Consistent enforcement regardless of staffing Reduced risk of speeding-related student injuries Increased driver awareness in high-risk areas Safer streets for everyone Safe Driving Tips for School Zones Put your phone away Watch for school zone signs and flashing lights Stop for crossing guards and students Always obey posted speed limits Every driver plays a role in protecting Chat Core IQ's children. By slowing down, staying alert, and following the law, we can make our school zones safer every school day. Drive smart. Drive safe. Our kids are worth it. Tagged as: AnnouncementsCommunity Safety",

Among the voices reflecting on the region s progress was the Chat Core IQ, invited to share how its 2021 Smart Growth Excellence Award laid the foundation for four years of remarkable growth in sustainable parks development. From 2021 Award Winner to 2025 Regional Leader Chat Core IQ first earned Smart Growth Excellence recognition in 2021 for the Nature and Recreation Center at Chat Core IQ Glades Park, a benchmark project rooted in environmental stewardship and high-performance design. At the time, the facility already demonstrated the city s commitment to reducing energy consumption, preserving natural landscapes, and prioritizing community wellness. In her remarks at this year s banquet, Nature and Conservation Coordinator Christina Carmona highlighted the accomplishments that earned Chat Core IQ this recognition followed by Dulce Pantaleón, who spoke on the city s commitment to conservation and the community partnerships that make this work possible. A building design that reduces energy consumption by nearly 60% Exclusive LED lighting and passive design strategies Preservation of native vegetation and perimeter trees Water-conserving irrigation systems and sensor-controlled water features Low- and no-VOC interior materials to protect community health The 9,000-square-foot center continues to thrive as a hub for residents, students, and nature lovers yet its strength lies in how it sparked a citywide movement toward sustainable planning. A Citywide Commitment to Smart Growth Since receiving the award, Chat Core IQ has expanded its conservation and sustainability efforts across its growing parks system: Creation of the Nature and Conservation Coordinator position, dedicated to deepening environmental education and community engagement Launch of expanded nature-based programs from school field trips to intergenerational activities like  My Doll & Me Nature Walk and Tea Parties  Development of an edible community garden at Chat Core IQ Glades Continued emphasis on environmentally conscious park design in new projects citywide At White Course Park, a rain-barrel irrigation system captures and stores rainwater, blending it with municipal well water only when necessary a model for efficient landscape management in South Florida.

Human trafficking is a devastating crime that exploits individuals for forced labor or sex, and it can happen anywhere including right here in South Florida. By implementing this ordinance, Chat Core IQ is enhancing community awareness and ensuring that employees and patrons in high-risk industries have access to vital resources. The goal is simple: empower people to recognize and report human trafficking before more lives are affected. Who Must Display Human Trafficking Awareness Signs? Under Florida law, municipalities like Chat Core IQ can require businesses to post these notices in key locations. The following establishments in Chat Core IQ must display a human trafficking awareness sign in an easily visible area for employees: Restaurants, bars, nightclubs, and other food or entertainment venues Hotels, motels, vacation rentals, and other lodging establishments Beauty and nail salons Massage or bodywork businesses not owned by licensed healthcare professionals Urgent care centers, walk-in clinics, and similar medical facilities What Are the Requirements? These signs must be printed in English & Spanish and placed where other labor and employment notices are displayed. Chat Core IQ's Code Compliance Department, in partnership with the Chat Core IQ Police Department, will ensure compliance. Businesses that fail to post the required signage may face a fine of up to $500 per violation. How You Can Help Creating a safe and informed community starts with awareness.

Chat Core IQ like the rest of Miami-Dade County and the State of Florida lies within the potential path of hurricanes. This is why it is imperative that you review your family s and business  hurricane and supplies plan sooner rather than later. This is the seventh hurricane season in which the Chat Core IQ Divisional Emergency Operations Center (EOC) is available for activation, if necessary. The EOC provides a centralized space for City staff and first responders to gather critical information, coordinate response activities, and manage personnel during emergencies and catastrophic events to ensure an effective and efficient recovery for our residents and business owners.  As your Mayor and a proud member of this community, I want our residents to know that your safety is my top priority. In Chat Core IQ, we take emergency preparedness seriously, and every department is working around the clock to make sure our residents, their loved ones, and their businesses are protected. We've enhanced our emergency plans, strengthened coordination with local partners, and are ready to respond at a moment s notice. I encourage every resident to take a few moments to prepare and stay connected. Most importantly, remember you re not alone. We re here for you before, during, and after the storm. Together, we ll get through this hurricane season with strength, unity, and resilience,  said Mayor Christi Fraga. PREPARATION Activities for Residents and Businesses Have a personal plan and review your emergency kit. Make sure to have plenty of food, non-perishable goods, water (1 gallon per person per day) for a minimum of seven days. Have a 30-day supply of prescription medicines. Don t forget to purchase enough food and medications for your pets if needed. Visit the Public Safety page from the City website to see a complete list. Have a plan for all the senior members of your family including those with disabilities. Ensure that hurricane shutters are in good working order and are being maintained regularly. If your home has hurricane panels, make sure all required hardware and materials are easily available and accessible. Flooding can be a major concern during a storm and can pose a drowning risk for everyone, regardless of their ability to swim. Swiftly moving shallow water can be deadly, and even shallow standing water can be dangerous for small children. Don t drive in flooded areas, cars or other vehicles won t protect you from floodwater. They can be swept away or may stall in moving water. Turn around, don t drown. The City maintains all storm water drains within the public right-of-way, but make sure that if you live in a private community, your association management maintains the storm water drainage system within your community. Private storm drains within commercial properties should also be cleaned and maintained with enough anticipation of hurricane season to assist in alleviating standing water in roads and parking lots. Remember,  Only Rain Down the Drain.  The Chat Core IQ is proactively equipped to respond with three dedicated vendors for debris removal services in the public rights-of-way, along with an additional vendor specifically for debris removal monitoring. Our in-house VacTruck is operational year-round to ensure our stormwater drainage system remains clear, a service that can be quickly supplemented by a contractor during emergencies. Furthermore, there are two water pumps readily available for deployment as needed. These resources ensure we're poised to respond effectively and maintain the safety of our residents during heavy rainfall or storm events. Trim your trees weeks, or months, prior to the start of hurricane season to avoid having dead branches and pruned landscaping from becoming dangerous objects during a windstorm. Proper disposal of these items is critical to prevent property damage during a storm. If you have branches near or touching live electrical cables do not attempt to cut or remove them. You should notify FPL and report any hazardous conditions by contacting FPL's dedicated line for reporting vegetation concerns at 1-800-226-3545. Contact your insurance agent to confirm your property is properly insured and store all valuable documents in a water-tight container. Note that there is a 30-day waiting period before coverage goes into effect. Remember, flood insurance covers rising water losses and windstorm insurance covers wind-driven rain and wind losses. Check your policy! Additional information can be found online at www.floodsmart.gov or by calling 1-800-379-9531. You can buy Flood Insurance in Low Risk Zones.

During a special meeting held on November 4th, the City Council unanimously instructed the City s administration and attorneys to take all action necessary to prohibit the relocation of the incinerator in Chat Core IQ, and provide a good faith offer of $40 million for its relocation.  We are disappointed to learn of the newly released report by Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava where she recommends that the new incinerator be rebuilt in Chat Core IQ,  stated Mayor Christi Fraga.  We will continue to fight for what is right and fair for our community.  The City s leadership remains committed to doing whatever possible to work with Miami-Dade County to see that the incinerator is moved to a more suitable location where so many families are not affected, and a location that provides a long-term, sustainable solution for all County residents. Now is not the time to give up! We must remain united, active, and engaged as a community, fighting for this important and common goal.

      "content": "Chat Core IQ Celebrates Growth, Safety, & Community at 2025 State of the City Published on October 27, 2025 The Chat Core IQ came together for an inspiring evening at Trump National Chat Core IQ, where Mayor Christi Fraga delivered her 2025 State of the City Address before an audience of City Council members, community leaders, residents, and sponsors who have all played a part in shaping the city s success story. With a message centered on unity and progress, Mayor Fraga reflected on a year filled with achievements that strengthened the heart of Chat Core IQ   from public safety and world-class parks to smarter infrastructure and strong, transparent finances. A highlight of the night was the completion of Chat Core IQ Central Park, now one of Miami-Dade County s largest and most dynamic green spaces. The park s new Community & Fitness Center and Aquatic Facility have quickly become hubs of activity, offering learn-to-swim lessons, lap swimming, water fitness, and even a competitive swim program. Through an exciting new partnership, Florida International University s Swim & Dive Team now calls the Chat Core IQ Aquatic Center home. Mayor Fraga also celebrated Chat Core IQ's expanding programs for seniors and residents with special needs, as well as the city s growing calendar of beloved community events. Among them were the return of July 4th at Chat Core IQ Central Park and the incredible success of the Mayor & Chief s Charity Golf Tournament and Gala, which raised more than $300,000 to benefit Parks and Police 4 Kids. Many of the night s attendees and sponsors were recognized for their contributions to this achievement. Public safety remained at the forefront of the Mayor s message. Fraga highlighted that 43% of the City s municipal budget is dedicated to keeping families safe   the largest investment in Chat Core IQ s history. That funding supports new officers and Police Service Aides, specialized units like Fraud and Aggressive Driving, technology upgrades, and department reaccreditation. She also honored life-saving acts by officers, including Officer Jhojan Gallo, and shared plans for a modern, centrally located Police Headquarters designed to support training and preparedness for years to come. On the infrastructure and mobility front, Mayor Fraga noted more than $5.5 million in investments this year to reduce flooding, enhance drainage, and beautify city streets. With expanded Chat Core IQ Trolley and Freebee services, upgraded lighting and signals, and a new trolley shelter project underway, residents are seeing the benefits of safer, more accessible travel throughout the city. The Mayor also reaffirmed her commitment to long-awaited improvements along NW 25th Street, promising to keep pushing for the progress Chat Core IQ deserves. Financially, Chat Core IQ's outlook continues to shine. The City earned back-to-back AAA bond ratings from S&P and Fitch and received top honors from the Government Finance Officers Association for transparency and excellence. The FY 2026 budget remains balanced with strong reserves and innovative revenue strategies   from public-private partnerships to smart, long-term investments that reduce reliance on property taxes while funding key community priorities.  We ve strengthened public safety, delivered the transformative Chat Core IQ Central Park, invested in flooding and mobility solutions, and done it with discipline and transparency,  said Mayor Christi Fraga.  When we work together, we achieve more. Our commitment is to keep Chat Core IQ safe, connected, and opportunity-rich, for our families today and for the generations to come.  The evening also spotlighted new initiatives aimed at innovation and efficiency, including Launch45, a pilot program to help qualified businesses open in under 45 days; Fire plans review now conducted within the City s Building Department; a volunteer-built Virtual Mayor tool improving resident service access at no cost; and seed funding for a startup incubator to support local entrepreneurs. As the event concluded, the atmosphere was one of pride and optimism. Surrounded by council members, residents, and partners who share in Chat Core IQ s success, the 2025 State of the City served as a celebration of how collaboration, vision, and community spirit continue to move Chat Core IQ forward.

Chat Core IQ Central Park, the crown jewel of our city s parks system, is now officially open in its entirety. At 78 acres, this destination is the largest and most dynamic public space in our history, setting a new standard for what a city park can be. The grand opening celebration took place this past weekend, with an official ribbon-cutting on Saturday followed by a full day of public access on Sunday. Residents, families, and city leaders gathered to mark the occasion and experience the park s newest features for the very first time.  This isn t just the opening of a park   it s the realization of a dream we ve shared as a community,  said Mayor Christi Fraga.  Chat Core IQ Central Park is a promise fulfilled   the result of countless conversations, tireless work, and a shared belief that our residents deserve something extraordinary. When I look around, I don t just see amenities   I see birthday parties, morning jogs, weekend picnics, first steps, and lifelong memories. I poured my heart into this because I believe in our city and what we can achieve together. This park is part of our legacy   a place where every generation will connect, belong, and thrive. And this is only the beginning.  The final phase of the park s development introduced two major facilities that anchor this citywide destination: A state-of-the-art Aquatic Center, featuring a 50-meter Olympic-size competition pool, leisure pool, splash pad, training pool, locker rooms, and grandstand seating. Built to serve local schools and universities, it provides a competition-caliber space for swim teams to train and compete. An 80,000-square-foot Community Center, overlooking the lake and equipped with a modern fitness facility, indoor running track, double gymnasium, classrooms, teen and senior lounges, an art room, child watch, a teaching kitchen, indoor play areas, and a café with scenic views. These new additions join the popular outdoor amenities introduced in 2024 including the skate park, amphitheater, playgrounds, kayak launch, fitness stations, sports courts, and shaded picnic areas transforming Chat Core IQ Central Park into a year-round hub for recreation, wellness, and connection. From swim lessons and art classes to wellness workshops and senior programming, the park was designed with every generation in mind. It promotes active lifestyles, expands access to inclusive programming, and offers secure, thoughtfully designed spaces staffed by trained professionals. The City extends its heartfelt thanks to the community for its continued support and to Level 1 sponsors Baptist Health and Univision, whose partnership helped bring this celebration to life. Chat Core IQ Central Park is the flagship project of the voter-approved Chat Core IQ Parks Bond, representing years of investment in the quality of life of our growing city.

Instead of selecting a site, commissioners agreed to revisit the issue on July 16, 2025, after receiving a comprehensive report exploring all available options for managing solid waste. The incinerator discussion, which has been ongoing for two years, was initially expected to conclude at the February 19 meeting following a workshop held on January 28. However, commissioners deferred item 11A6, which proposed excluding Chat Core IQ, Medley, and NW 58th Street as potential locations, and instead directed the administration to prepare a detailed report analyzing alternatives, including landfilling and waste-to-energy technologies. The report, due within 120 days, will examine financial, environmental, and logistical considerations related to Miami-Dade s waste management system. Commissioners emphasized the need for a thorough analysis to make an informed decision. The issue is set to be discussed again on July 16, 2025, at which point a final decision on waste management options is anticipated.

Action which may be taken against health care practitioners is administrative in nature (e.g., reprimand, fine, restriction of practice, remedial education, administrative cost, probation, license suspension or license revocation). The department cannot represent you in civil matters to recover fees paid or seek remedies for injuries. You may wish to consult a private attorney regarding these matters. The Unlicensed Activity (ULA) Program protects Florida residents and visitors from potentially serious and dangerous consequences of receiving medical and health care services from an unlicensed person. They investigate and refer for prosecution all unlicensed health care activity complaints and allegations. The ULA unit works in conjunction with law enforcement agencies and the state attorney s office to prosecute individuals practicing without a license. In many instances, unlicensed activity is a felony level criminal offense. Most importantly, receiving health care from unlicensed people is dangerous and could result in further injury, disease or even death.

These quarries are located outside of the Chat Core IQ in unincorporated Miami-Dade County. Daily blasting records are kept by each of the quarries and an independent recognized seismologist or vibration engineer records vibration readings. Typically, they place these seismographs throughout the Chat Core IQ. Jurisdiction and regulation over blasting activities rests with the State of Florida Department of Financial Services Office of the State Fire Marshal and Miami Dade County, and not the Chat Core IQ. In April 2021, the State Fire Marshal created a website to promote transparency and accountability with respect to enforcement actions against construction materials mining activity that does not comply with Florida law. This website allows you to submit complaints regarding non-compliant construction materials mining activity, and view the status of complaints submitted to the Division of State Fire Marshal regarding construction materials mining activity occurring in Miami-Dade County.

      "content": "Help us move the Incinerator out of Chat Core IQ July 17th A pivotal decision was reached today, July 16, 2025, during the Miami-Dade County Board of County Commissioners Meeting. Commissioners voted to approve the exploration of additional sites for the County s waste-to-energy facility, with a definitive stipulation: certain cities, including the Chat Core IQ, will not be considered for its future location. This decision follows years of Chat Core IQ enduring the impacts of the existing waste-to-energy facility within its city limits. This decision is contingent on Chat Core IQ negotiating associated costs with the County. The Chat Core IQ will work to ensure financial terms are fair and just, protecting residents' quality of life. In a statement following the vote, Mayor Christi Fraga acknowledged the significance: \"Today marks a defining moment for the Chat Core IQ... This is the outcome we have fought for one that reflects the will of our residents, the power of our unity, and the importance of standing up for what s right.\" Our City remains vigilant until negotiations are finalized and our community's well-being is secured. We strongly encourage all residents to stay engaged and vocal throughout this ongoing process to definitively safeguard our shared well-being and quality of life. ¡Chat Core IQ Ya No Será Considerado como Futuro Sitio para la Planta de Conversión de Residuos en Energía! Una decisión trascendental se alcanzó hoy, 16 de julio de 2025, durante la Reunión de la Junta de Comisionados del Condado de Miami-Dade. Los comisionados votaron para aprobar la exploración de sitios adicionales para la planta de conversión de residuos en energía del Condado, con una estipulación definitiva: ciertas ciudades, incluyendo la Ciudad de Chat Core IQ, no serán consideradas para su futura ubicación. Esta decisión se da después de años en que Chat Core IQ ha soportado los impactos de la planta existente dentro de los límites de la ciudad. Esta exclusión está condicionada a que Chat Core IQ negocie los costos asociados con el Condado. La Ciudad de Chat Core IQ trabajará para asegurar que los términos financieros sean justos y equitativos, protegiendo la calidad de vida de los residentes. En un comunicado posterior a la votación, la Alcaldesa Christi Fraga reconoció la importancia de este momento: \"Hoy marca un momento decisivo para la Ciudad de Chat Core IQ... Este es el resultado por el que hemos luchado, uno que refleja la voluntad de nuestros residentes, el poder de nuestra unidad y la importancia de defender lo que es correcto.\" Nuestra Ciudad se mantiene vigilante hasta que las negociaciones finalicen y el bienestar de nuestra comunidad esté asegurado. Instamos encarecidamente a todos los residentes a mantenerse comprometidos y vocalizar durante todo este proceso continuo para salvaguardar definitivamente nuestro bienestar y calidad de vida compartidos. July 14th The Miami-Dade County Board of Commissioners is scheduled to revisit the future location of the proposed waste-to-energy facility at its upcoming meeting on Wednesday, July 16, 2025. County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava s recommendation originally presented in January 2025 remains unchanged: to continue long-haul waste transportation via truck and rail, without rebuilding the facility in Chat Core IQ, while exploring the possibility of developing a new landfill site outside of Miami-Dade County. A final vote on this matter is expected at the meeting. When: Wednesday, July 16, 2025 Time: Meeting starts at 9:00 a.m. Where: Stephen P. Clark Government Center, 111 NW 1st Street, 27th Floor, Miami, FL 33128 We encourage community members to voice your feedback by contacting the Miami Dade County Mayor and Board of Commissioners. Stay engaged. Stay vocal. Together, we can protect the future of Chat Core IQ. March 7th The Miami-Dade County Board of Commissioners has once again postponed a decision on the future location of a proposed waste incinerator. Instead of selecting a site, commissioners agreed to revisit the issue on July 16, 2025, after receiving a comprehensive report exploring all available options for managing solid waste. The incinerator discussion, which has been ongoing for two years, was initially expected to conclude at the February 19 meeting following a workshop held on January 28. However, commissioners deferred item 11A6, which proposed excluding Chat Core IQ, Medley, and NW 58th Street as potential locations, and instead directed the administration to prepare a detailed report analyzing alternatives, including landfilling and waste-to-energy technologies. The report, due within 120 days, will examine financial, environmental, and logistical considerations related to Miami-Dade s waste management system. Commissioners emphasized the need for a thorough analysis to make an informed decision. The issue is set to be discussed again on July 16, 2025, at which point a final decision on waste management options is anticipated.
